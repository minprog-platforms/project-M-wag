26- April

    Started properly working on gas distribution

    Basic mechanism: A cell spread it's content equally to all cells in the neighborhood(including itself)

    Impelemted: get_neighborhood, out_of_bounds, spread, change_value, get_value, add_value, spread_grid, visualize_grid

    get_neighborhood and out_of_bounds heavily inspired from Mesa library

    spread initiates from (0, 0) causing unequal distribution
    when using spread_grid make each cell pass it's spread values to a tempory list of list and then change whole value of oxygen map

    visualize using heatmap 



    --After Labwork & Betabreak--

    Implemented SPread Grid Function Propery 
    Visualizing is fucked, corners and borders are odd
    Heatmap in general is a bad metric because it indicates relative color

    Requirement: Make a 2D grid that can store information from multiple variables.
    Interaction in the 2D grid needs to be able to take place between varaiables of the same type
    Agents also need to be able to move from grid to grid

    Option 1: List of List with dicts
    Option 2: Dataframe with multinindex

    Option 1 Benefits:
        -Easier to Impelement
        -Easier to work with data structure
    Option 1 Downsides:
        -Possibly Slower

    Option 2 Benefits:
        -Increase in speed
        -Less esoteric datastructure
        -Better interaction with other classes
    Option2 Downsides:
        -Harder to implement 
        -Is a DataFrame useful for a 2D spatia grid
        -Unreadable

    Chose to use a list of dicts because visualizing is easier along with easier implementation
    Translated most functions to be usable with multiple variable

    Next step:
        Likely Option: 
            Store the spread distribution to a temporary grid of ints
            Find a efficient way to change the entry of the dictionaries to this
            
            example: for (x, y) in MultiVarGrid, cell[x][y][variable] = temp[x][y]
            O(N) scales linearly with size of Grid

        (Possibly Better) Alterantive:
            temp_grid is a copy of MultiVarGrid
            only variable that is of interest is set to 0 and incremented to

            example: 
            temp grid = MultiVarGrid
            for (x,y) temp grid[variable] = spread_amount(x,y)
            MultiVarGrid = temp Grid
            O(1) simply reference temp grid now

    Ended just iterating through each grid and changing the dict

    Future Iplementation:
        -The higher the concetration, the more spread
        example radius = rounddown(cell.value/3) + 1

    Next Plan:
        -Fish implementation

18-May
 
Working on find algae.
 When generating algae it's all the same variable
 
       Finish Determinstic Food Location
       Add Oxygen Mechanism
        Add Birth Mechanism

Movement and visualization are most important so working on that RN

	Visualization has been fixed.
	New move_to_food function passing wrong data type to model.grid.move_agent
	
	Figure out how to make data type FloatCoordinate
	After that is done movement should be random. Algae visualization needs to be implemented

25-May-2022

	Goal:
	Implement FloatCoordinate datatype

26-May-2022
	Float Coordianate was not the issue, stochastic locate_food was exporing [tuple] not tuple
	Determistic search always goes to top right corner
	
	Goals:
	Visualize Algae
	Visualize Multiple Fish in one Corner
	
	Make algae testing environment
	Make algae random
	Finish Fish Eating
	Change to SingleGrid
	Make a function that just takes a dictionary and adds that to fish
	Make Algae Distribitution Random


	Accomplished:
	Fish Eat Algae
	Fish will regulate eating

	Next Time:
	Fish Death
	Turn it Single Grid
	Birth Function

27-May-20
	Single Grid Function:
		-Agent Allocation Cannot Overlap
		-Cannot move to new Neighbors
		-Cannot give birth on a neighbor`

	Fish Death
        - Remove Fish From Scheduler
        - Make invisble on screen
    
    Birth:
        -Creates new Fish
        -Not Unique
        -Place on other fish

    Tommorow:
        Fix Birth
        Add Oxygen
	
28-May-2022
	
	-No Unique Id
	-Birth on same place

29-May-22
	-Algae Growth Mostly Finished
	-Becaue fully satured squares do not give spread some squares get stuck
