## Background
Eutrophication refers to the processwhereby a body of water experiences an increase in nutrients. A common consequence of this is algal bloom, the rapid increase in the growth of the algae population. This process occurs naturally, however can be sped up by human activty. Which is referred to as cultural euthrophication.

##  Problem
A body of water is also inhabitated by other plants and fish. Algae bloom can block sunlight c


##  Model Requirements
An accurate simulation requires that under normal conditions a body of water should see no or limited change. Only upon introduction of a large nutrient increase should harmful bloom occur. 

##  Prerequisites
####  Modules
Mesa
Matplotlib
####  Similar Implementations


####  Hardest Parts
Ecosystem Homeostatis in absence of nutrient increases
